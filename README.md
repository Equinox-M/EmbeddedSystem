## Q&A:
Br Mahmoud: Which are the parts that the Embedded Systems are divided into?\n
My answer: The embedded system is divided into hardware, software, and real-time operating system.

Sis Ezza: What are the commonly found errors in embedded systems?\n
My answer: Damage of memory devices due to transient current and static discharges.
Some memory locations being inaccessible in storage due to garbage or errors.
Faulty control signals.

Br Omar: Why embedded system is useful?\n
My answer: Besides the advantages i mentioned With embedded system, it is possible to replace dozens or even more of hardware logic gates, input buffers, timing circuits, output drivers, etc. with a relatively cheap microprocessor.

Br Azim: what is the difference between microprocessor and microcontroller?
My answer: Microprocessor is managers of the resources (I/O, memory) which lie outside of its architecture.
Microcontroller have I/O, memory, etc. built into it and specifically designed for control.

## Week 4 - GPIO

Examples include turning ON and OFF LEDs at different timings, as well as making button counters with debouncing.

## Week 5 - Analog Input

Examples include potentiometer with ADC using default arduino library, ADC with On-demand mode, ADC with auto-trigger mode.

## Week 6 - Timer Ports

Examples include generating PWM signals using Fast PWM mode & Phase Correct PWM mode with different timer ports, duty cycles and pre-scaler values.

## Week 7 - Interrupts

Example include applying external interrupts, pin change interrupts and timer interrupts using buttons and LEDs.

## Week 8 - Non Volatile Memory

Examples include reading, writing, updating data in EEPROM (electrically erasable programmable read-only memory) in Arduino (also using put and get function).

## Week 9 - Power Management

Example include power saving methods like disabling ADCs, Analog Comparators and Sleeping mode with BOD disabled.

## Week 10 - Interfacing with Motors

Examples include using PWM and pulses to control DC motors, servo and stepper motors.

## Week 11 - Communication with other devices

Example include Serial Communication between Arduino and the computer through Serial Monitor

## Week 12 - Serial Communication

Examples include Serial communication between Arduino using USART, SPI and I2C communication.

## Week 13 - Interfacing Circuits

Examples include logic level shifting from 3.3V logic level to 5V logic level.

## Week 14 - Design Choices

Difference between microcontrollers (Arduino etc) and microcomputers (Raspberry Pi)
